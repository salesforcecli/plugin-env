DESCRIPTION
  Create a sandbox org.

  There are two ways to create a sandbox org: specify a definition file that contains the sandbox options or use the
  --name and --license-type flags to specify the two required options. If you want to set an option other than name or
  license type, such as apexClassId, you must use a definition file.

EXAMPLES
  Create a sandbox org using a definition file and give it the alias "MyDevSandbox". The production org that contains
  the sandbox license has the alias "prodOrg".

    $ sf env create sandbox -f config/dev-sandbox-def.json --alias MyDevSandbox --target-org prodOrg

  Create a sandbox org by directly specifying its name and type of license (Developer) instead of using a definition
  file. Set the sandbox org as your default.

    $ sf env create sandbox --name mysandbox --license-type Developer --alias MyDevSandbox --target-org prodOrg \
      --set-default

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -a, --alias=<value>  Alias for the sandbox org.

    When you create a sandbox, the generated usernames are based on the usernames present in the production org. To
    ensure uniqueness, the new usernames are appended with the name of the sandbox. For example, the username
    "user@example.com" in the production org results in the username "user@example.com.mysandbox" in a sandbox named
    "mysandbox". When you set an alias for a sandbox org, it's assigned to the resulting username of the user running
    this command.

  -c, --clone=<value>  Name of the sandbox org to clone.

    The value of clone must be an existing sandbox in the same target-org.

  -f, --definition-file=<value>  Path to a sandbox definition file.

    The sandbox definition file is a blueprint for the sandbox. You can create different definition files for each
    sandbox type that you use in the development process. See
    <https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_sandbox_definition.htm> for all
    the options you can specify in the defintion file.

  -n, --name=<value>  Name of the sandbox org.

    The name must be a unique alphanumeric string (10 or fewer characters) to identify the sandbox. You canâ€™t reuse a
    name while a sandbox is in the process of being deleted.

  -o, --target-org=<value>  Username or alias of the production org that contains the sandbox license.

    When it creates the sandbox org, Salesforce copies the metadata, and optionally data, from your production org to
    the new sandbox org.

  -w, --wait=<minutes>  Number of minutes to wait for the sandbox org to be ready.

    If the command continues to run after the wait period, the CLI returns control of the terminal to you and displays
    the "sf env resume sandbox" command you run to check the status of the create. The displayed command includes the
    job ID for the running sandbox creation.

  --async  Request the sandbox creation, but don't wait for it to complete.

    The command immediately displays the job ID and returns control of the terminal to you. This way, you can continue
    to use the CLI. To check the status of the sandbox creation, run "sf env resume sandbox".

  --no-track-source  Do not use source tracking for this sandbox.

    We recommend you enable source tracking in Developer and Developer Pro sandbox, which is why it's the default
    behavior. Source tracking allows you to track the changes you make to your metadata, both in your local project and
    in the sandbox, and to detect any conflicts between the two.

    To disable source tracking in the new sandbox, specify the --no-track-source flag. The main reason to disable source
    tracking is for performance. For example, while you probably want to deploy metadata and run Apex tests in your
    CI/CD jobs, you probably don't want to incur the costs of source tracking (checking for conflicts, polling the
    SourceMember object, various file system operations.) This is a good use case for disabling source tracking in the
    sandbox.
```

## `sf env create scratch`

Create a scratch org.

```
USAGE
  $ sf env create scratch [--json] [-a <value>] [--async] [-d] [-f <value>] [-v <value>] [-c] [-e

                                 partner-group|partner-professional>
  -f, --definition-file=<value>  Path to a scratch org definition file.
  -i, --client-id=<value>        Consumer key of the Dev Hub connected app.
  -t, --[no-]track-source        Use source tracking for this scratch org. Set --no-track-source to disable source
                                 tracking.
  -v, --target-dev-hub=<value>   Username or alias of the Dev Hub org.
  -w, --wait=<minutes>           Number of minutes to wait for the scratch org to be ready.
  -y, --duration-days=<days>     Number of days before the org expires.
  --api-version=<value>          Override the api version used for api requests made by this command
  --async                        Request the org, but don't wait for it to complete.

PACKAGING FLAGS
  -c, --no-ancestors  Don't include second-generation managed package (2GP) ancestors in the scratch org.
  -m, --no-namespace  Create the scratch org with no namespace, even if the Dev Hub has a namespace.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Create a scratch org.

  There are two ways to create a scratch org: specify a definition file that contains the options or use the --edition
  flag to specify the one required option. If you want to set options other than the edition, such as org features or
  settings, you must use a definition file.

  You must specify a Dev Hub to create a scratch org, either with the --target-dev-hub flag or by setting your default
  Dev Hub with the target-dev-hub configuration variable.

EXAMPLES
  Create a Developer edition scratch org using your default Dev Hub and give the scratch org an alias:

    $ sf env create scratch --edition=developer --alias my-scratch-org

  Specify the Dev Hub using its alias and a scratch org definition file. Set the scratch org as your default and
  specify that it expires in 3 days:

    $ sf env create scratch --target-dev-hub=MyHub --definition-file config/project-scratch-def.json --set-default \
      --duration-days 3

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -a, --alias=<value>  Alias for the scratch org.

    New scratch orgs include one administrator by default. The admin user's username is auto-generated and looks
    something like test-wvkpnfm5z113@example.com. When you set an alias for a new scratch org, it's assigned this
    username.

  -e, --edition=developer|enterprise|group|professional|partner-developer|partner-enterprise|partner-group|partner-professional

    Salesforce edition of the scratch org.

    The editions that begin with "partner-" are available only if the Dev Hub org is a Partner Business Org.

  -f, --definition-file=<value>  Path to a scratch org definition file.

    The scratch org definition file is a blueprint for the scratch org. It mimics the shape of an org that you use in
    the development life cycle, such as acceptance testing, packaging, or production. See
    <https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_scratch_orgs_def_file.htm> for
    all the option you can specify in the definition file.

  -t, --[no-]track-source  Use source tracking for this scratch org. Set --no-track-source to disable source tracking.

    We recommend you enable source tracking in scratch orgs, which is why it's the default behavior. Source tracking
    allows you to track the changes you make to your metadata, both in your local project and in the scratch org, and to
    detect any conflicts between the two.

    To disable source tracking in the new scratch org, specify the --no-track-source flag. The main reason to disable
    source tracking is for performance. For example, while you probably want to deploy metadata and run Apex tests in
    your CI/CD jobs, you probably don't want to incur the costs of source tracking (checking for conflicts, polling the
    SourceMember object, various file system operations.) This is a good use case for disabling source tracking in the
    scratch org.

  -v, --target-dev-hub=<value>  Username or alias of the Dev Hub org.

    Overrides the value of the target-dev-hub configuration variable, if set.

  -w, --wait=<minutes>  Number of minutes to wait for the scratch org to be ready.

    If the command continues to run after the wait period, the CLI returns control of the terminal to you and displays
    the job ID. To resume the scratch org creation, run the env resume scratch command and pass it the job ID.

  --async  Request the org, but don't wait for it to complete.

    The command immediately displays the job ID and returns control of the terminal to you. This way, you can continue
    to use the CLI. To resume the scratch org creation, run "sf env resume scratch".
```

    $ sf env delete scratch --target-org=my-scratch-org --no-prompt
```

## `sf env display`

Display details about an environment.

```
USAGE
  $ sf env display [--json] [-e <value>]

FLAGS
  -e, --target-env=<value>  Environment alias or login user.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Display details about an environment.

  Specify an environment with either the username you used when you logged into the environment with "sf login", or the
  alias you gave the environment when you created it. Run "sf env list" to view all your environments and their aliases.

  Output depends on the type of environment. For example, scratch org details include the access token, alias, username
  of the associated Dev Hub, the creation and expiration date, the generated scratch org username, and more. Compute
  environment details include the alias, connected orgs, creation date, project name, and more.

EXAMPLES
  Display details about a scratch org with alias my-scratch-org:

    $ sf env display --target-env=my-scratch-org

  Specify a username instead of an alias:

    $ sf env display --target-env=test-123456-abcdefg@example.com

  Specify JSON format and redirect output into a file:

    $ sf env display --target-env=my-scratch-org --json > tmp/MyOrdDesc.json
```

## `sf env list`

List the environments youâ€™ve created or logged into.

```
USAGE
  $ sf env list [--json] [-a] [--columns <value>] [--csv] [--filter <value>] [--no-header] [--no-truncate]
    [--output csv|json|yaml] [--sort <value>]

FLAGS
  -a, --all             Show all environments, even inactive ones.
  --columns=<value>...  List of columns to display.
  --csv                 Output in csv format [alias: --output=csv]
  --filter=<value>      Filter property by partial string matching.
  --no-header           Hide table header from output.
  --no-truncate         Don't truncate output to fit screen.
  --output=<option>     Format in which to display the output.
                        <options: csv|json|yaml>
  --sort=<value>        Column to sort by (prepend '-' for descending).

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  List the environments youâ€™ve created or logged into.

  By default, the command displays active environments. For orgs, active means unexpired scratch orgs and orgs youâ€™re
  currently logged into.

  Output is displayed in multiple tables, one for each environment type. For example, the Salesforce Orgs table lists
  the non-scratch orgs youâ€™re logged into, such as sandboxes, Dev Hubs, production orgs, and so on. Scratch orgs and
  compute environments get their own tables.

  The two org tables show similar information, such as aliases, information about the org, and how you authorized
  (logged into) it, such as with a web browser or JWT. The scratch org table also shows the expiration date. For
  non-scratch orgs, the Username column refers to the user you logged into the org with. For scratch orgs it refers to
  the username that was generated for you when you created the scratch org. Your default scratch org or Dev Hub org is
  indicated with the "target-org" or "target-dev-hub" configuration variable, respectively, in the Config column.

  The compute environment table shows the alias, information about the connected orgs, the project name, and more.

  Use the table manipulation flags, such as --filter and --sort, to change how the data is displayed.

  Run "sf env display" to view details about a specific environment.

EXAMPLES
  List all active environments:

    $ sf env list

  List both active and inactive environments:

    $ sf env list --all

  Filter the output to list only orgs you authorized using a web browser; "Auth Method" is the name of a column:

    $ sf env list --filter "Auth Method=web"

  Display only the Aliases column and sort the aliases in descending order:

    $ sf env list --sort "-Aliases" --columns "Aliases"

  Don't truncate the displayed output and instead wrap text that's wider than your terminal:

    $ sf env list --no-truncate

  Display only the table data, not the headers, in comma-separated value (csv) format:

    $ sf env list --csv --no-header
```

## `sf env open`

Open an environment in a web browser.

```
USAGE
  $ sf env open [--json] [-p <value>] [-r] [-e <value>] [--browser <value>]

FLAGS
  -e, --target-env=<value>  Login user or alias of the environment to open.
  -p, --path=<value>        Path to append to the end of the login URL.
  -r, --url-only            Display the URL, but donâ€™t launch it in a browser.
  --browser=<value>         Browser in which to open the environment.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Open an environment in a web browser.

  You can open the following types of environments in a web browser: scratch orgs, sandboxes, Dev Hubs, and production
  orgs. Run "sf env list" to view your environments and their aliases and login usernames.

  Each of your environments is associated with an instance URL, such as https://login.salesforce.com. To open a specific
  web page, specify the portion of the URL after "<URL>/" with the --path flag, such as /apex/YourPage to open a
  Visualforce page.

EXAMPLES
  Open the Visualforce page /apex/StartHere in a scratch org with alias test-org:

    $ sf env open --target-env test-org --path /apex/StartHere

  View the URL but don't launch it in a browser:

    $ sf env open --target-env test-org --path /apex/StartHere --url-only

  Open the environment in the Google Chrome browser:

    $ sf env open --target-env test-org --path /apex/StartHere --browser chrome

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -e, --target-env=<value>  Login user or alias of the environment to open.

    Specify the login user or alias thatâ€™s associated with the environment. For scratch orgs, the login user is
    generated by the command that created the scratch org. You can also set an alias for the scratch org when you create
    it.

    For Dev Hubs, sandboxes, and production orgs, specify the alias you set when you logged into the org with "sf
    login".

  --browser=<value>  Browser in which to open the environment.

    You can specify that the environment open in one of the following browsers: Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, or
    Windows Edge. If you donâ€™t specify --browser, the environment opens in your default browser. The exact names of the
    browser applications differ depending on the operating system you're on; check your documentation for details.
```

## `sf env resume sandbox`

Check the status of a sandbox creation, and log in to it if it's ready.

```
USAGE
  $ sf env resume sandbox [--json] [-w <value>] [-n <value> | -i <value>] [-l] [-o <value>]

FLAGS
  -i, --job-id=<value>      Job ID of the incomplete sandbox creation that you want to check the status of.
  -l, --use-most-recent     Use the most recent sandbox create request.
  -n, --name=<value>        Name of the sandbox org.
  -o, --target-org=<value>  Username or alias of the production org that contains the sandbox license.
  -w, --wait=<minutes>      Number of minutes to wait for the sandbox org to be ready.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Check the status of a sandbox creation, and log in to it if it's ready.

  Sandbox creation can take a long time. If the original "sf env create sandbox" command either times out, or you
  specified the --async flag, the command displays a job ID. Use this job ID to check whether the sandbox creation is
  complete, and if it is, the command then logs into it.

  You can also use the sandbox name to check the status or the --use-most-recent flag to use the job ID of the most
  recent sandbox creation.

EXAMPLES
  Check the status of a sandbox creation using its name and specify a production org with alias "prodOrg":

    $ sf env resume sandbox --name mysandbox --target-org prodOrg

  Check the status using the job ID:

    $ sf env resume sandbox --job-id 0GRxxxxxxxx

  Check the status of the most recent sandbox create request:

    $ sf env resume sandbox --use-most-recent

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -i, --job-id=<value>  Job ID of the incomplete sandbox creation that you want to check the status of.

    The job ID is valid for 24 hours after you start the sandbox creation.

  -o, --target-org=<value>  Username or alias of the production org that contains the sandbox license.

    When it creates the sandbox org, Salesforce copies the metadata, and optionally data, from your production org to
    the new sandbox org.

  -w, --wait=<minutes>  Number of minutes to wait for the sandbox org to be ready.

    If the command continues to run after the wait period, the CLI returns control of the terminal window to you and
    returns the job ID. To resume checking the sandbox creation, rerun this command.
```

## `sf env resume scratch`

Resume the creation of an incomplete scratch org.

```
USAGE
  $ sf env resume scratch [--json] [-i <value>] [-r]

FLAGS
  -i, --job-id=<value>   Job ID of the incomplete scratch org create that you want to resume.
  -r, --use-most-recent  Use the job ID of the most recent incomplete scratch org.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Resume the creation of an incomplete scratch org.

  When the original "sf env create scratch" command either times out or is run with the --async flag, it displays a job
  ID.

  Run this command by either passing it a job ID or using the --use-most-recent flag to specify the most recent
  incomplete scratch org.

EXAMPLES
  Resume a scratch org create with a job ID:

    $ sf env resume scratch --job-id 2SR3u0000008fBDGAY

  Resume your most recent incomplete scratch org:

    $ sf env resume scratch --use-most-recent

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -i, --job-id=<value>  Job ID of the incomplete scratch org create that you want to resume.

    The job ID is the same as the record ID of the incomplete scratch org in the ScratchOrgInfo object of the Dev Hub.

    The job ID is valid for 24 hours after you start the scratch org creation.
