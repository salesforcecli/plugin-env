### Build

To build the plugin locally, make sure to have yarn installed and run the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:salesforcecli/plugin-env

# Install the dependencies and compile
yarn install
yarn build
```

To use your plugin, run using the local `./bin/run` or `./bin/run.cmd` file.

```bash
# Run using local run file.
./bin/run env
```

There should be no differences when running via the Salesforce CLI or using the local run file. However, it can be useful to link the plugin to do some additional testing or run your commands from anywhere on your machine.

```bash
# Link your plugin to the sfdx cli
sfdx plugins:link .
# To verify
sfdx plugins
```

## Commands

<!-- commands -->

- [`sf env display`](#sf-env-display)
- [`sf env list`](#sf-env-list)
- [`sf env open`](#sf-env-open)

## `sf env display`

Display details about an environment.

```
USAGE
  $ sf env display [--json] [-e <value>]

FLAGS
  -e, --target-env=<value>  Environment alias or login user.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Display details about an environment.

  Specify an environment with either the username you used when you logged into the environment with "sf login", or the
  alias you gave the environment when you created it. Run "sf env list" to view all your environments and their aliases.

  Output depends on the type of environment. For example, scratch org details include the access token, alias, username
  of the associated Dev Hub, the creation and expiration date, the generated scratch org username, and more. Compute
  environment details include the alias, connected orgs, creation date, project name, and more.

EXAMPLES
  Display details about a scratch org with alias my-scratch-org:

    $ sf env display --target-env=my-scratch-org

  Specify a username instead of an alias:

    $ sf env display --target-env=test-123456-abcdefg@example.com

  Specify JSON format and redirect output into a file:

    $ sf env display --target-env=my-scratch-org --json > tmp/MyOrdDesc.json
```

## `sf env list`

List the environments you’ve created or logged into.

```
USAGE
  $ sf env list [--json] [-a] [--columns <value>] [--csv] [--filter <value>] [--no-header] [--no-truncate]
    [--output csv|json|yaml] [--sort <value>]

FLAGS
  -a, --all             Show all environments, even inactive ones.
  --columns=<value>...  List of columns to display.
  --csv                 Output in csv format [alias: --output=csv]
  --filter=<value>      Filter property by partial string matching.
  --no-header           Hide table header from output.
  --no-truncate         Don't truncate output to fit screen.
  --output=<option>     Format in which to display the output.
                        <options: csv|json|yaml>
  --sort=<value>        Column to sort by (prepend '-' for descending).

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  List the environments you’ve created or logged into.

  By default, the command displays active environments. For orgs, active means unexpired scratch orgs and orgs you’re
  currently logged into.

  Output is displayed in multiple tables, one for each environment type. For example, the Salesforce Orgs table lists
  the non-scratch orgs you’re logged into, such as sandboxes, Dev Hubs, production orgs, and so on. Scratch orgs and
  compute environments get their own tables.

  The two org tables show similar information, such as aliases, information about the org, and how you authorized
  (logged into) it, such as with a web browser or JWT. The scratch org table also shows the expiration date. For
  non-scratch orgs, the Username column refers to the user you logged into the org with. For scratch orgs it refers to
  the username that was generated for you when you created the scratch org. Your default scratch org or Dev Hub org is
  indicated with the "target-org" or "target-dev-hub" configuration variable, respectively, in the Config column.

  The compute environment table shows the alias, information about the connected orgs, the project name, and more.

  Use the table manipulation flags, such as --filter and --sort, to change how the data is displayed.

  Run "sf env display" to view details about a specific environment.

EXAMPLES
  List all active environments:

    $ sf env list

  List both active and inactive environments:

    $ sf env list --all

  Filter the output to list only orgs you authorized using a web browser; "Auth Method" is the name of a column:

    $ sf env list --filter "Auth Method=web"

  Display only the Aliases column and sort the aliases in descending order:

    $ sf env list --sort "-Aliases" --columns "Aliases"

  Don't truncate the displayed output and instead wrap text that's wider than your terminal:

    $ sf env list --no-truncate

  Display only the table data, not the headers, in comma-separated value (csv) format:

    $ sf env list --csv --no-header
```

## `sf env open`

Open an environment in a web browser.

```
USAGE
  $ sf env open [--json] [-p <value>] [-r] [-e <value>] [--browser <value>]

FLAGS
  -e, --target-env=<value>  Login user or alias of the environment to open.
  -p, --path=<value>        Path to append to the end of the login URL.
  -r, --url-only            Display the URL, but don’t launch it in a browser.
  --browser=<value>         Browser in which to open the environment.

GLOBAL FLAGS
  --json  Format output as json.

DESCRIPTION
  Open an environment in a web browser.

  You can open the following types of environments in a web browser: scratch orgs, sandboxes, Dev Hubs, and production
  orgs. Run "sf env list" to view your environments and their aliases and login usernames.

  Each of your environments is associated with an instance URL, such as https://login.salesforce.com. To open a specific
  web page, specify the portion of the URL after "<URL>/" with the --path flag, such as /apex/YourPage to open a
  Visualforce page.

EXAMPLES
  Open the Visualforce page /apex/StartHere in a scratch org with alias test-org:

    $ sf env open --target-env test-org --path /apex/StartHere

  View the URL but don't launch it in a browser:

    $ sf env open --target-env test-org --path /apex/StartHere --url-only

  Open the environment in the Google Chrome browser:

    $ sf env open --target-env test-org --path /apex/StartHere --browser chrome

FLAG DESCRIPTIONS
  -e, --target-env=<value>  Login user or alias of the environment to open.

    Specify the login user or alias that’s associated with the environment. For scratch orgs, the login user is
    generated by the command that created the scratch org. You can also set an alias for the scratch org when you create
    it.

    For Dev Hubs, sandboxes, and production orgs, specify the alias you set when you logged into the org with "sf
    login".

  --browser=<value>  Browser in which to open the environment.

    You can specify that the environment open in one of the following browsers: Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, or
    Windows Edge. If you don’t specify --browser, the environment opens in your default browser. The exact names of the
    browser applications differ depending on the operating system you're on; check your documentation for details.
