# summary

Open an environment in your web browser.

# description

You can open the following types of environments in a web browser: scratch orgs, sandboxes, Dev Hubs, and production orgs.

If you run the command without flags, it attempts to open your default environment in your default web browser.

Each of your environments is associated with an instance URL, such as https://login.salesforce.com. To open a specific web page at that URL, specify the portion of the URL after "<URL>/" with the --path flag, such as /apex/YourPage to open a Visualforce page.

# flags.path.summary

Path to append to the end of the login URL.

# flags.url-only.summary

Display the URL, but don’t launch it in a browser.

# flags.target-env.summary

Environment name or alias to open.

# flags.target-env.description

Specify the login user or alias that’s associated with the environment. For scratch orgs, the login user is generated by the command that created the scratch org. You can also set an alias for the scratch org when you create it.

For Dev Hubs, sandboxes, and production orgs, specify the alias you set when you logged into the org with "sf login".

# flags.browser.summary

Browser in which to open the environment.

# flag.browser.description

Specify a browser by its app name according to your operating system. For example, Chrome’s app name is "google chrome" on macOS, "google-chrome" on Linux and "chrome" on Windows. So to open an environment in Chrome on macOS, specify --browser "google chrome". If you don’t specify --browser, the environment opens in your default browser.

# examples

- To open your default environment, run the command without flags:
  sf env open
- This example opens the Visualforce page /apex/StartHere in a scratch org
  with alias "test-org":

  sf env open --target-env test-org --path /apex/StartHere

- If you want to view the URL for the preceding command, but not launch it in a browser,
  add the --url-only flag:

  sf env open --target-env test-org --path /apex/StartHere --url-only

- The preceding examples open the environment in your default web browser. To use
  a different browser, set the --browser flag to its OS-specific name. For example,
  to use Chrome on macOS:

  sf env open --target-env test-org --path /apex/StartHere --browser "google chrome"
